By default, pytest runs tests in sequential order. In a real scenario, a test suite will have
a number of test files and each file will have a bunch of tests. This will lead to a large
execution time. To overcome this, pytest provides us with an option to run tests in parallel.
For this, we need to first install the pytest-xdist plugin.
Install pytest-xdist by running the following comman

`pip install pytest-xdist`

Now, we can run tests by using the syntax pytest -n <num>
e,g pytest -n 3

-n <num> runs the tests by using multiple workers, here it is 3
